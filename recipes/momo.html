    <h3>Prepare the Dough:</h3>
   <details>Mix Flour and Salt: In a large bowl, combine the flour and salt.
    Add Water: Gradually add water while kneading the dough until it becomes smooth and elastic. You may need a little more or less water.
    Rest Dough: Cover the dough with a damp cloth or plastic wrap and let it rest for at least 30 minutes.</details>
</li>
   <li> <h3>Prepare the Filling:</h3>
        <details>Cook Aromatics: Heat oil in a pan over medium heat. Add the minced garlic and ginger, and sautÃ© until fragrant.
        Cook Meat or Vegetables: Add the chopped meat or vegetables to the pan. Cook until they are fully cooked and any liquid has evaporated.
        Season: Add soy sauce, black pepper, cumin, coriander, and salt. Mix well. If using, add chopped cilantro or green onions.
        Cool Filling: Allow the filling to cool before using it.</details>
    </li>

<li><h3>Assemble the MOMO:</h3>
<details>Roll Out Dough: Divide the dough into small balls. Roll each ball into a thin circle on a floured surface. Aim for about 3-4 inches in diameter.
    Add Filling: Place a spoonful of filling in the center of each circle.
    Shape momo: Fold the dough over the filling to form a half-moon shape. Pinch the edges to seal, or pleat the edges to create a traditional momo shape.

    <h3>Cook the Momo:</h3>
    <details>
        Prepare Steamer: Line a steamer basket with parchment paper or cabbage leaves to prevent sticking. Bring water to a boil in the steamer pot.
Steam momo: Place the momo in the steamer basket, making sure they are not touching each other. Steam for about 10-15 minutes, or until the dough is cooked and the filling is hot.
