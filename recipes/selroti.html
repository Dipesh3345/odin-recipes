            <h3>Prepare the Batter:</h3>
            <details>
                Mix Dry Ingredients: In a large bowl, combine the rice flour, sugar, cardamom powder, baking powder, and salt.
Add Wet Ingredients: Gradually add water and milk to the dry ingredients, stirring continuously to form a smooth, thick batter. The consistency should be similar to pancake batter, thick enough to coat a spoon but not too runny. Adjust the water or milk as needed to achieve the right consistency.

            <h3>Heat the Oil</h3>
            <details>
                Prepare the Pan: Heat a generous amount of oil in a deep frying pan or wok over medium heat. The oil should be enough to submerge the Sel Roti while frying.
Test the Temperature: To check if the oil is hot enough, drop a small spoonful of batter into the oil. If it rises to the surface and starts bubbling, the oil is ready.

    <h3>Shape and Fry:</h3>
    <details>
        Shape the Sel Roti: Traditionally, Sel Roti is shaped by hand. Dip your fingers in the batter and shape it into a ring or doughnut shape directly over the hot oil. You can also use a spoon to drop the batter into the oil and shape it with the back of the spoon.
Fry Until Golden: Fry the Sel Roti on medium heat until it turns golden brown and crispy. Turn it over as needed to ensure even cooking. It should take about 2-3 minutes per side.
Drain Excess Oil: Use a slotted spoon to remove the Sel Roti from the oil and place it on a paper towel-lined plate to drain any excess oil.
